[Variation of information](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variation_of_information)
(also known as *shared information distance*) is a measure of the
distance between the two clusterings. It is devised from the *mutual
information*, but it is a true metric, *i.e.* it is symmetric and satisfies
the triangle inequality.
