K-means
==========

`K-means <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_means>`_ is a classic method for clustering or vector quantization. The K-means algorithms produces a fixed number of clusters, each associated with a *center* (also known as a *prototype*), and each sample belongs to a cluster with the nearest center. 

From a mathematical standpoint, K-means is a coordinate descent algorithm to solve the following optimization problem:

.. math::

    \mathrm{minimize} \ \| \mathbf{x}_i - \boldsymbol{\mu}_{z_i} \|^2

    \mathrm{w.r.t.} \ (\boldsymbol{\mu}, z)

Here, :math:`\boldsymbol{\mu}_k` is the center of the ``k``-th cluster, and :math:`z_i` indicates the cluster for :math:`\mathbf{x}_i`. 


This package implements the *K-means* algorithm in the ``kmeans`` function:

.. function:: kmeans(X, k; ...)

    Performs K-means clustering over the given dataset.

    :param X:   The given sample matrix. Each column of ``X`` is a sample. 
    :param k:   The number of clusters.

    This function returns an instance of ``KmeansResult``, which is defined as follows:

    .. code-block:: julia

        type KmeansResult{T<:FloatingPoint} <: ClusteringResult
            centers::Matrix{T}         # cluster centers, size (d, k)
            assignments::Vector{Int}   # assignments, length n
            costs::Vector{T}           # costs of the resultant assignments, length n
            counts::Vector{Int}        # number of samples assigned to each cluster, length k
            cweights::Vector{Float64}  # cluster weights, length k
            totalcost::Float64         # total cost (i.e. objective)
            iterations::Int            # number of elapsed iterations 
            converged::Bool            # whether the procedure converged
        end

    One may optionally specify some of the options through keyword arguments to control the algorithm:

    ==============  ===========================================================  ========================
     name            description                                                  default
    ==============  ===========================================================  ========================
     ``init``        Initialization algorithm or initial seeds, which can be      ``:kmpp``
                     either of the following:

                     - a symbol indicating the name of seeding algorithm, 
                       ``:rand``, ``:kmpp``, or ``:kmcen`` (see :ref:`cinit`)
                     - an integer vector of length ``k`` that provides the
                       indexes of initial seeds. 
    --------------  -----------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------
     ``maxiter``     Maximum number of iterations.                                ``100``
    --------------  -----------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------
     ``tol``         Tolerable change of objective at convergence.                ``1.0e-6`` 
    --------------  -----------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------
     ``weights``     The weights of samples, which can be either of:              ``nothing``

                     - ``nothing``: each sample has a unit weight.
                     - a vector of length ``n`` that gives the sample weights.
    --------------  -----------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------
     ``display``     The level of information to be displayed.                    ``:none``
                     (see :ref:`copts`)
    ==============  ===========================================================  ========================

If you already have a set of initial center vectors, you may use ``kmeans!`` instead:

.. function:: kmeans!(X, centers; ...)

    Performs K-means given initial centers, and updates the centers inplace. 

    :param X: The given sample matrix. Each column of ``X`` is a sample. 
    :param centers: The matrix of centers. Each column of ``centers`` is a center vector for a cluster. 

    **Note:** The number of clusters ``k`` is determined as ``size(centers, 2)``. 

    Like ``kmeans``, this function returns an instance of ``KmeansResult``.

    This function accepts all keyword arguments listed above for ``kmeans`` (except ``init``). 


**Examples:**

.. code-block:: julia

    using Clustering

    # make a random dataset with 1000 points
    # each point is a 5-dimensional vector
    X = rand(5, 1000)

    # performs K-means over X, trying to group them into 20 clusters
    # set maximum number of iterations to 200
    # set display to :iter, so it shows progressive info at each iteration
    R = kmeans(X, 20; maxiter=200, display=:iter)

    # the number of resultant clusters should be 20
    @assert nclusters(R) == 20

    # obtain the resultant assignments
    # a[i] indicates which cluster the i-th sample is assigned to 
    a = assignments(R)

    # obtain the number of samples in each cluster
    # c[k] is the number of samples assigned to the k-th cluster
    c = counts(R)

    # get the centers (i.e. mean vectors)
    # M is a matrix of size (5, 20)
    # M[:,k] is the mean vector of the k-th cluster
    M = R.centers

Example with plot

.. code-block:: julia

    using RDatasets
    
    iris = dataset("datasets", "iris")
    head(iris)
    
    # K-means Clustering unsupervised machine learning example
    
    using Clustering
    
    features = permutedims(convert(Array, iris[:,1:4]), [2, 1])   # use matrix() on Julia v0.2
    result = kmeans( features, 3 )                                # onto 3 clusters
    
    using Gadfly
    
    plot(iris, x = "PetalLength", y = "PetalWidth", color = assignments(result), Geom.point)
