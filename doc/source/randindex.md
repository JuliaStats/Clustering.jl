# Rand index

[Rand index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rand_index) is a measure of
the similarity between the two data clusterings. From a mathematical
standpoint, Rand index is related to the accuracy, but is applicable
even when class labels are not used. The measure was introduced in

> Lawrence Hubert and Phipps Arabie (1985). *Comparing partitions.*
> Journal of Classification 2 (1): 193–218
