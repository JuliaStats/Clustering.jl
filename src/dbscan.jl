"""
    dbscan(points::AbstractMatrix, radius::Real,
           [leafsize], [min_neighbors], [min_cluster_size]) -> Vector{DbscanCluster}

Cluster `points` using the DBSCAN (density-based spatial clustering of
applications with noise) algorithm.

# Arguments
 - `points`: the ``d×n`` matrix of points. `points[:, j]` is a
   ``d``-dimensional coordinates of ``j``-th point
 - `radius::Real`: query radius

Optional keyword arguments to control the algorithm:
 - `leafsize::Int` (defaults to 20): the number of points binned in each
   leaf node in the `KDTree`
 - `min_neighbors::Int` (defaults to 1): the minimum number of a *core* point
   neighbors
 - `min_cluster_size::Int` (defaults to 1): the minimum number of points in
   a valid cluster

# Example
``` julia
points = randn(3, 10000)
# DBSCAN clustering, clusters with less than 20 points will be discarded:
clusters = dbscan(points, 0.05, min_neighbors = 3, min_cluster_size = 20)
